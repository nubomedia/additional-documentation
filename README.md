What is NUBOMEDIA
-----------------

This project is part of [NUBOMEDIA], which is an open source cloud Platform as a
Service (PaaS) which makes possible to integrate Real Time Communications (RTC)
and multimedia through advanced media processing capabilities. The aim of
NUBOMEDIA is to democratize multimedia technologies helping all developers to
include advanced multimedia capabilities into their Web and smartphone
applications in a simple, direct and fast manner. To accomplish that objective,
NUBOMEDIA provides a set of APIs that try to abstract all the low level details
of service deployment, management, and exploitation allowing applications to
transparently scale and adapt to the required load while preserving QoS
guarantees.
